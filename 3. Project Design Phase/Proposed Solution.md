# Implemented public website design

HDI Intelligence uses a cyan visual identity with clean light surfaces, dark ink typography, subtle gradients and deep-teal dark mode. An original SVG mark represents health, education and standard of living and is reused as the favicon. The permanent sidebar, workspace breadcrumbs, profile-style block and persistent internship badge are removed.

A compact sticky top navbar provides Home, Explore Data, HDI Predictor, Scenarios and Methodology, with AI Settings and theme controls. The mobile menu opens below the navbar and supports dismissal. Fluid page layouts, focus states, native dialog behavior and reduced-motion support are implemented; their responsive and automated accessibility checks are recorded in folder 6; automated results do not replace human review.

Home introduces the three dimensions and links directly to prediction and published data. Explore Data preserves exact country/year observations and explicit missing values. The predictor groups four inputs by dimension and distinguishes model estimates from the direct formula. Scenarios show baseline and edited values as hypothetical comparisons. Methodology explains existing measured results without inventing new evaluation.

AI Settings uses a masked personal-key field with show/hide, use/change/remove controls and connection feedback. Saving a key changes local memory only. Explicitly generating an explanation sends it to this site's serverless endpoint; the privacy notice states that the hosting server receives it. Refresh clears the key. Provider failures do not affect local HDI calculations.

CSS transitions and chart reveals are lightweight and respect reduced motion. Every page shares the attribution **Created by Madireddy Meena Mahanth Harinadh ❤️**. Existing hash routes, exports, input validation, stale-result warnings and scenario resets remain part of the implementation. Phase 2 screenshots are historical and do not represent this redesign.


## Phase 4 functional repair - 28 October 2026

Phase 4 repairs actual chart viewport sizing without redesigning the cyan interface. The selected year updates historical coverage; missing observations are explained rather than interpolated. Navigation, exports, numerical comparisons and personal-key controls are covered by the targeted current checks recorded in folder 6.

See the current verification record in `6. Project Testing` and the updated academic report in folder 7.
